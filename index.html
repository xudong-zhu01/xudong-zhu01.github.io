  <h2>WELCOME!</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Xudong Zhu. I am a PhD candidate in International History at
    <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 32)">the University of Aberdeen.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    I hold a Master of Arts in American Studies from
    <span style="color: rgb(150, 0, 24)"
      >Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg</span
    >, Germany, and a Bachelor’s degree in Law with a focus on Diplomacy from
    <span style="color: rgb(14, 65, 156)">Jilin University</span>, China. My
    academic journey has centered on International Relations, encompassing
    international history, IR theory, international law, and international
    organizations. At Heidelberg, I specialized in U.S. history, politics, and
    the transatlantic alliance.

    German history, and the European Union.
