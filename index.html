My name is Xudong Zhu. I am a PhD candidate in International History at the University of Aberdeen. 
<br>
<br>
My dissertation, tentatively titled <i>"Germany’s Impact on China’s Rebuilding and Modernization: Beyond a Geo-Military Perspective (1928–1938)"</i>, explores the largely overlooked military and strategic cooperation between the Weimar Republic/Third Reich and the Nanjing Government of the Republic of China. This interdisciplinary study bridges history and international relations, examining how the German grand strategy influenced China’s vision of great power status.
<br>
<br>
By analyzing the ideological and strategic exchanges between these two countries, my research aims to deepen our understanding of China’s early 20th-century modernization. It will also demonstrate how strategic ideas transcend cultural and national boundaries, shaping state-building and military development in diverse geopolitical contexts.
<br>
<br>
I hold a Master of Arts in American Studies from Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg, Germany, and a Bachelor’s degree in Law with a focus on Diplomacy from Jilin University, China. My academic journey has centered on International Relations, encompassing international history, theoretical frameworks, international law, and international organizations. At Heidelberg, I specialized in U.S. history and politics, developing deep expertise in areas such as U.S. economic policy, the transatlantic alliance, nuclear deterrence theory, and Trump-era politics. My research interests also extend to German politics and foreign affairs, German history, and the European Union.
